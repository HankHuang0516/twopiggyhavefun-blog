# Project: Pixnet Blog Migration to Astro

## Project Overview
This project is a static blog migrated from Pixnet to Astro. It uses a "Magazine" style layout with TailwindCSS.

## Core Workflows

### 1. Content Management & Scraping
- **Scraping**: Use `scrape_pixnet.js` to fetch articles from `pixnet_articles_db.json`.
- **Images**:
  - **Flickr**: Do NOT download. Hotlink directly to save space (logic implemented in `repair_images.js`).
  - **Pixnet**: Download locally to `public/images/posts/` to prevent link rot.
  - **Repair**: Run `node repair_images.js` to fix broken links or missing images.
- **Dates**: Run `node fix_dates.js` to ensure frontmatter `date` matches the original Pixnet publish date.

### 2. Business Status Verification
- **Report**: Maintain `business_status.md` for checking shop statuses.
- **Automation**: Run `node mark_closed_businesses.js`. This script reads `business_status.md` (identifying "已歇業" status) and automatically injects a "Closed Shop" warning banner into the markdown of articles mentioning closed businesses.

### 3. Deployment (GitHub Pages)
- **Method**: GitHub Actions (`.github/workflows/deploy.yml`).
- **Configuration**: Must set `site` and `base` in `astro.config.mjs` correctly.
  - `site`: `https://<username>.github.io`
  - `base`: `/<repo-name>`
- **Common Issues**:
  - **404 Error**: Ensure GitHub Pages "Source" is set to "GitHub Actions" in Settings.
  - **Push Failure (500/Timeout)**: Check for large untracked files (e.g., `gen_ai_*`, `node_modules`) that might have been accidentally staged. Use `git push -f` if history gets bloated with garbage objects.

## Technical Stack
- **Framework**: Astro 5.x
- **Styling**: TailwindCSS + @tailwindcss/typography
- **Scripts**: Node.js (Axios, Cheerio)
- **Content**: Markdown/MDX with Frontmatter

## Rules for AI Agents
- **Aesthetics**: Maintain the "Magazine" style. Use high-quality images and responsive grids.
- **Business Logic**: Always verify business status before answering "where to eat" queries based on this content.
- **Image Strategy**: Prioritize external linking for Flickr; download only when necessary (Pixnet/other).
